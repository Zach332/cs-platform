                            <p>A full-stack website built similar to Reddit in functionality but with a focus on engineering projects. Users can make requests to work with others on a project they outline within specific technical fields (like languages, frameworks, or overarching purposes). If completed on the website, users can follow up and post what their projects turned out to be. Lets engineering students create products with real, demonstrable impact (work backwards from an actual need), and helps people that have good ideas but no engineering skills (like people in CS just starting out).

                            CS students that can't think of good project ideas can match with those and create the proposed project. CS students can create products with real, demonstrable impact in direct communication with others, and helps people that have great ideas but no programming skills; accounts, posts, frontend, backend.

                            Projects in embedded systems, machine learning/AI, data visualization, game development, digital logic, and electrical engineering can be hashed out with others.
